## The Administrator Dashboard

This is the instructor's homepage. From here an instructor can perform several categorized duties.

### Medications Category

- View Signatures: 
	This displays a list of student signatures in the database organized by time. Signatures are added when students use [the scanner utility](#scan-medication) and complete a summary attestation. These signatures allow you to determine which of your students have administered medication. Signatures show the name of the student, the time they administered medication, what medication(s) they administered, and which patient they administered it to.
- View Medications: 
	This redirects to the medications page as explained in [Medications.](#medications)
- Create Medication: 
	This allows you to add a new medication to the database.
- Format Medication: 
	QR codes serve as an important back-up in case the system's bar code generator fails. In order to ensure consistent results, the system demands that medication QR codes are formatted in a very particular manner. The medication data formatter is a tool that will allow you to properly format medication information if you ever need to print new QR codes. First enter all the necessary information into the text boxes, leaving some boxes blank when they are not needed. Then click on the 'Format' button and copy the output below 'Formatted code data:'. You can paste the output into any QR code generator as plain text.
